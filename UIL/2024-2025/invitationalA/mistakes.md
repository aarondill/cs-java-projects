These are the mistakes made during the competition. They have been revised and committed.

- Alberto: Note: we got points for this (idk how). The '5' is too wide. Delete the column after the pipe.
- Dominik: Logic error. Use the `ChronoUnit` class instead.
- Helen:
  1.  Logic error if `tokenWithX == 2` and `sign == '-'`. Subtract should be add.
  2.  Integer division in all places except coeef
