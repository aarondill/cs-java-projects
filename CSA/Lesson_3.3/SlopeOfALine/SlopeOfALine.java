 * Lab 3.3.1 â€“SlopeOfALine - Write a program that will allow the user to enter
 * an four int values, x1, y1, x2, and y2, that represent two points on a line.
 * If the line is not a vertical line, calculate and print the slope of the
 * line. If the line is vertical, output a statement stating that the line is a
 * vertical line and the slope is undefined.
