 * Lab 4.2.2 â€“ CountDown2 - Write a program that allows the user to enter two
 * whole numbers. The first number should be smaller than the second number.
 * Print all of the numbers from the second number down to the first number.
 * Print each number on same line. If the first number is larger than the second
 * number, then the program should not print anything. (see Topic 4.2 Practice
 * Labs
 * 
 * Modify CountDown from lab 4.2.2 so that the user is required to enter a first
 * number that is smaller than the second number. Use a while loop to check for
 * valid input
