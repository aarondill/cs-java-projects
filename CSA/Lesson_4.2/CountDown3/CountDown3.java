 * Summary of file:
 * Lab 4.2.2 â€“ CountDown3 - Write a program that allows the user to enter two
 * whole numbers. The first number should be smaller than the second number.
 * Print all of the numbers from the second number down to the first number.
 * Print each number on same line. If the first number is larger than the second
 * number, then the program should not print anything. (see Topic 4.2 Practice
 * Labs
 * 
 * Modify CountDown from lab 4.2.2 so that it does not matter which number is
 * the largest. The program should always count down from the largest number to
 * the smallest number
