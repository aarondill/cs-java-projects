 * Lab 2.9.1 - TemperatureDifference â€“ Write a program that will allow the user
 * to enter two temperatures. The program should then print the difference
 * between the temperatures without regard for whether the temperature became
 * warmer or colder. The output should be formatted and labelled just as you see
 * in this sample run:
 * 
 * Resulting Output:
 * Enter the first temperature: 50
 * Enter the second temperature: 75
 * The temperature changed 25 degrees.
