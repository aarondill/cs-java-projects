 * Summary of file:
 * Lab 2.9.4 - SquareWordRoot â€“ OK, this problem is a little silly. We are going
 * to find the square root of a word! Let's pretend that the "square root" of a
 * word is the letter indexed by the square root of its length. Consider the
 * word applejack. Applejack has nine letters. The square root of nine is three.
 * So the "square root" of applejack is l. That works great for words with a
 * length that is a perfect square. What about television? Television has ten
 * letters. The square root of 10 is approximately 3.162277660. Obviously we
 * can't use that decimal value as an index for a String. For the purposes of
 * this problem let's round that value to the nearest whole number. In this case
 * that would be 3. So the "square root" of television is e.
 * 
 * Just to keep things simple, assume that none of the words that the user might
 * enter will be one letter words. Every word will have two or more letters.
 * 
 * Write a program that will prompt the user for a word and then prints the
 * "square root" of that word. Your output must include the quotation marks
 * around the words "square root". Here are sample runs using applejack and
 * television.
 *
 * <pre>
 * Enter your word: applejack
 * The "square root" of applejack is 1
 * Enter your word: television
 * The "square root" of television is e
