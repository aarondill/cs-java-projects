 * Summary of file:
 * Lab 2.9.3 - QuadraticFormula â€“ To find the solutions to a quadratic equation
 * you must use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula states that where
 * ax2 + bx + c the solutions are
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * There can be two solutions, one solution or no solutions to any given
 * equation depending on how many times the graph of the equation crosses the x
 * axis. You are going to write a program that will calculate the value of x for
 * equations that always have two solutions. Allow the user to enter the values
 * for a, b and c then calculate both solutions to the equation. A sample run
 * for the equation x2+5x+6=0 would look like this.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Enter the values for a, b, and c:  1 5 6
 * x = -2.0 and -3.0
 * </pre>
