 * Summary of file:
 * Lab 2.9.3 - Distance â€“ Use what you have learned in math class or a textbook
 * or the Internet to find the formula to determine the distance between two
 * points. Before you write the program, calculate the distance between two
 * different pairs of points of your own choosing. Then write a program that
 * will allow the user to enter the coordinates of two points. The program
 * should then calculate and print the distance between those two points. You
 * must use all Math class methods to perform the calculations. Test your
 * program using the values you calculated for the points that you chose before
 * you began to code. Format the prompts and the output just as you see in this
 * sample run.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Enter the coordinates of the first point (x1,y1): 2 -3
 * Enter the coordinates of the second point (x2,y2): -4 1
 * The distance between (2,-3) and (4,-1) is 7.211102550927978
 * </pre>
